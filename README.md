this is a simple repo im making to improve my logic building in JASASCRIPT , i will be making 30 js based projects in 30 days as an improvement goal in my day to day life. 
first 10 projects will be considered a little easy ( coin toss , color switcher ) and some more easy to medium level project. in these 10 projects the very first 5 will be complete basic.
next 10 projects will be of intermediate level and the last 10 will be considered intermediate to hard.

i will be following javascript documentation and some resources. but the goal is to build a muscle memory connection in javascript. 
this is all to prevent me from using AI in my future projects , so right now i have to grind from the very basics. 

GROW ^
